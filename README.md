#Analysis For Marketing Campaign Performance And Customer Engagements

#Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset from a direct marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to extract actionable insights and design an interactive dashboard to improve customer engagement strategies. The campaign data was collected via phone calls, with the objective of predicting client acceptance of a term deposit offer.
Objectives
1.	Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
2.	Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard created in Excel.
3.	Provide actionable recommendations to improve future marketing strategies.


#Key Features

•	Data Analysis: Cleaned and analyzed data using Excel pivot tables, charts, and formulas.
•	Interactive Dashboard: Designed an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic Excel dashboard to display key KPIs, trends, and customer segmentation.
•	Actionable Insights:
o	Customers in the secondary education level had the highest acceptance rates.
o	May recorded the highest number of customer calls, while December had the lowest.
o	Married individuals had the highest call engagements.
o	Acceptance rates are notably lower among customers with loan defaults.

#Deliverables

•	Excel File: Contains cleaned data, pivot tables, and the final dashboard.
